      <p className="terms-content">
        <strong>3.1 In General.</strong> The App offers users the opportunity to
        participate in skill-based photography contests ("Contests") by
        submitting photographs in various themed categories (e.g., nature,
        urban, portraits, etc.). These contests are designed to test artistic
        and technical photography skills and creativity.
      </p>
      <p className="terms-content">
        <strong>3.2 Skill-Based Judging.</strong> Each Contest operates as a
        game of skill where photographs submitted by participants are presented
        in a head-to-head voting format to users of the App. Votes are tallied
        and analyzed to determine which photos are most preferred by the
        community. Winners are determined based on aggregate user votes and
        other skill-based criteria defined in each contest description.
      </p>
      <p className="terms-content">
        <strong>3.3 Contest Types and Entry.</strong>

          based on voting results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>(c) Sponsored Contests.</strong> Select contests may be

        won through participation in the Contests at a particular time does not
        imply or warrant future availability. <strong>Important:</strong> PikMe
        reserves the right to cancel any Contest for any reason before the
        start. Should such cancellation occur, your entry fee will be refunded.
      </p>

        <strong>4.3 Confirmation of Submissions.</strong> During a Contest, a

        designated as an AI-generated content Contest, AI use is strictly
        prohibited. All submitted photographs must be original works created by
        the user. Except as expressly permitted under the rules of a particular
        Contest, the use of AI-generated or heavily manipulated content intended
        to simulate photography is not allowed and may result in
        disqualification, forfeiture of prizes, and account suspension.

        your participation in the applicable Contest, eligible to participate in
        accordance with the Contest description and these Terms, and that your
        participation was in accordance therewith. If you do not provide such
        proof to our reasonable satisfaction, you may forfeit the Prize. We
        retain sole, absolute, and non-appealable discretion to determine the
        winner of each Contest. By participating in any Contest, you agree to be

        Depending on the state in which you reside, we may also send you
