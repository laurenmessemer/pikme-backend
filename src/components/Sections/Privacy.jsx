        cookies through your browser settings, we do not currently respond to a
        “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile

        <strong>P. Photo Ownership and License.</strong> You retain ownership of

      <p>
        <strong>Q. Retention of Contest Submissions and Results.</strong> We
        retain user-submitted content, contest entry data, and results for as

      <h2 className="terms-subtitle">12. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING</h2>
      <p className="terms-content">
        <strong>A. Automated Decision-Making.</strong> Some contest outcomes
        (e.g., advancement in tournaments or tie-breaking) may be determined
        using automated systems such as vote tallies or scoring algorithms.
        These decisions do not involve legal profiling but may affect contest
        outcomes or prize eligibility. Final decisions are subject to
        verification and may involve human review in cases of dispute.
      </p>
      <p className="terms-content">
        <strong>B. AI and Moderation Technologies.</strong> We may use automated
        tools, including machine learning models, to assist with content
        moderation, fraud detection, and contest scoring. These tools operate
        based on pre-defined criteria and are reviewed periodically for fairness
        and accuracy. However, final enforcement decisions may involve human
        oversight.
      </p>

        inadvertently collected data from a child without parental consent, we
        will delete such information as quickly as possible.
